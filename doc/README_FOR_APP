This project is intended (for now) primarily to be able to use the
ActiveRecord ORM to wrap parts of our etd/vireo database in order to
do batch type processing. There's not actually any plan to put a real
Rails app up - it's just more convenient to start with it to have all
the machinery in place so we can just define models, rake tasks,
etc. as needed to accomplish what batch processing we want.
